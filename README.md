This is a collection of my notes on the basics of C#. I have written these notes somewhat as though I am talking myself and somewhat as though I am talking to the reader or referring to me and the reader as 'us' or 'we'. This is because my initial idea when writing these notes was simply to have a place to look back to in case I forget something, but then I realized that I was going over quite alot of information that can be useful to others who are trying to learn the language as well. So, I changed the style of the notes midway to be more like that of a textbook. One day I hope to properly rewrite all these notes in the style of a textbook and publish them.
